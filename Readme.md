## Use Case 1: Podcast Insights Dashboard

### Description
Processes `.csv` podcast data (e.g., episode metadata, listener stats) to extract insights such as listener trends, top-performing episodes, and publishing schedules.

### Workflow
1. Upload `.csv` files to S3 bucket.
2. AWS Glue ETL job transforms data and catalogs it.
3. Athena queries generate metrics.
4. QuickSight visualizes episode performance.

## Use Case 2: AWS Cost Monitoring Dashboard

### Description
Analyzes AWS CUR data to understand cloud cost distribution, identify top spenders by service/region, and track monthly trends.

### Workflow
1. CUR reports delivered automatically to S3.
2. AWS Glue processes and partitions the cost data.
3. Athena executes queries to segment and aggregate cost information.
4. Dashboards in QuickSight display KPIs, anomalies, and cost breakdowns.
